Ultimirror
==========

My take on the increasingly-popular smart mirror craze.

Unlike other implementations, Ultimirror uses modular widgets and layouts, has a backend/frontend architecture allowing modules to directly control local hardware elements (eg. sensors), and provides a separate admin page to remotely configure your mirror by visiting a webpage on your local network.
